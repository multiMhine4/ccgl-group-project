# Quotation Analysis of Volodymyr Zelenskyy

Our group's research question is: *how does Chinese and US media frame Volodymyr Zelenskyy's quotes differently?*

# Methodology

We sampled 6 Chinese media and ? US media sources respectively randomly and we then analysed each source for quotes in the date range February 24 to April 24. We chose the starting date to be the day the [2022 Russian invasion on Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-authorises-military-operations-donbass-domestic-media-2022-02-24/) started.

The table below lists all the sampled Chinese media and whether or not they were national or regional media. Since they are all state-owned media, we omit their political stance, which we identify to be that of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). To a large extent, the current political thought of the party is [neoauthoritarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoauthoritarianism_(China)), which can be described as *classically conservative*.^[1]
